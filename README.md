# Cancel Requests With Axios

This is a project to my post on [How to use Axios Cancel Tokens with React Redux](https://rhythmandbinary.com/post/2021-08-11-how-to-use-axios-cancel-tokens-with-react-redux).

I recommend checking out [the Axios docs on Cancel Tokens](https://axios-http.com/docs/cancellation).

## Running Locally

This project uses a local express server alongside a React application. I have both working with an npm script and [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently). To get started just do:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```
